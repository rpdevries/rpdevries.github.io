My name is Raina DeVries, and I am a paleontologist currently working in the Sereno Lab at the University of Chicago. I started working in the Sereno Lab in 2020 while obtaining my bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago. My work involves the digital restoration of dinosaur skeletons and muscles, and software development. My dinosaur research is primarily focused on Thyreophora, the clade of armored dinosaurs. The following images can be selected to reveal details about my research.
