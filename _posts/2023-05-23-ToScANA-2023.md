At Tomography for Scientific Advancement North America 2023 (ToScANA 2023), I presented *FossilScope*: An Interactive Application for Documenting 3D Skeletal Restoration. *FossilScope* is a free application that will allow the user to understand the steps taken to restore a fossil skeleton by displaying the information through direct engagement with the 3D skeletal mesh - i.e. the selection of fossil or muscle elements. The concept of *FossilScope* was well-received, with many people excited for its release.

More details on *FossilScope* [**here**](https://rainadevries.com/01_SoftwareDeveloper/).
