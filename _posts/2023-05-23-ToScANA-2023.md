At ToScANA 2023 this year, I presented [*FossilScope*](https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.833379): An Interactive Application for Documenting 3D Skeletal Restoration. *FossilScope* is a free application that will allow the user to view and understand the steps taken to restore a fossil skeleton by displaying the information through direct engagement with the 3D skeletal mesh - i.e. the selection of fossil or muscle elements. The concept of *FossilScope* was well-received, with many people excited for its release.
