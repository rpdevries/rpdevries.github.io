At the Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology 2023, 

(1) I presented a talk on the small, armored dinosaur.

(2) Prof. Paul Sereno presented a talk on *FossilScope*: An Interactive Application for Documenting 3D Skeletal Restoration. The end of the talk included an interactive software demonstration of *FossilScope*. *FossilScope* is a free application that will allow the user to understand the steps taken to restore a fossil skeleton by displaying the information through direct engagement with the 3D skeletal mesh - i.e. the selection of fossil or muscle elements. The demo was well-received, with many researchers interested in using *FossilScope* for their own work.

The interactive demo of *FossilScope* featured the flesh and skeletal models of *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus*. The user could toggle the visibility of the flesh model on or off to access the bones of the skeleton. On the flesh model, the user could click on an element to access a summary note and relevant statistics. On the skeletal model, the user could click on an element to access relevant information including a summary note, fossil specimen ID(s), an outline of the restorative steps taken, and images of the original bone(s) or reference images of a sculpted bone. This interactive demo is only the beginning of *FossilScope*, and we plan to include many more features in the final product.
