No longer an undergraduate, I returned to Wyoming to visit the dig site that first sparked my interest in paleontology. There were a few bones of the new diplodocoid left to excavate... Carrying a 300lb fossil vertebra up a steep and muddy incline...

<!--
Traveling out West to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur - digging in the dirt with my bare hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster - was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills of Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation - home to famous dinosaurs such as *Allosaurus*, *Camarasaurus*, and *Stegosaurus* - to finish the excavation of a 15-ton diplodocoid. -->
