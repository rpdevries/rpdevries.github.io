I decided to return to Wyoming to revisit the dig site that first sparked my interest in paleontology, but this time as a researcher and not as an undergraduate. Lead by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, the team traveled to Wyoming to finish the excavatin of a new diplodocoid from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. While most of the bones of the new diplodocoid were excavated on the last trip - [Dinosaur Science 2019](https://www.google.com) - a few bones remained to be recovered.

Traveling out West to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur - digging in the dirt with my bare hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster - was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills of Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation - home to famous dinosaurs such as *Allosaurus*, *Camarasaurus*, and *Stegosaurus* - to finish the excavation of a 15-ton diplodocoid. -->

For a short while, I went off on my own to prospect for fossils. The red hills were void of life, or so I thought. I was scanning the ground for fossil fragments, when I looked up and locked eyes with *Sylvilagus audubonii* - the desert cottontail - who had been quietly observing me from a safe distance.

After finding a few fossil fragments and bidding the furry critter goodbye, I returned to the site of the diplodocoid to continue with excavation. Armed with a drill, we brock the rock around and underneath the vertebra to free it from the ground.

After the fossil was rolled out of the pit, the underside was coated in burlap and plaster in preparation for transport.

We had to carry our prize - a 300lb diplodocoid vertebra - up the steep and muddy incline to the transport truck. However, with no machines in sight, our only option was human labor. To prepare the fossil for transport, two ragged blue tarps were laid in a cross formation on the ground. The fossil was rolled on top of the tarps and wrapped up, and then the whole thing was secured with rope. Each person took one end of the tarp, hoisted the fossil up, and walked up the hill.
