Returning to Wyoming

I returned to Wyoming to revisit the dig site that first sparked my interest in paleontology, but this time as a researcher and not as an undergraduate. There were a few bones of the new diplodocoid left to excavate. 

<!--
Traveling out West to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur - digging in the dirt with my bare hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster - was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills of Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation - home to famous dinosaurs such as *Allosaurus*, *Camarasaurus*, and *Stegosaurus* - to finish the excavation of a 15-ton diplodocoid. -->

While off on my own, prospecting for fossils, . The hills were void of life, or so I thought. I was scanning the ground for fossil fragments, when I looked up and locked eyes with *Sylvilagus audubonii* - a desert cottontail. The little guy was observing my fossil findings from a safe distance.

After prospecting for a while, I returned to the site of the diplodocoid.

After the fossil was rolled out of the pit, the underside was coated in burlap and plaster in preparation for transport.

We had to carry our prize - a 300lb diplodocoid vertebra - up the steep and muddy incline to the transport truck. However, with no machines in sight, our only option was human labor. To prepare the fossil for transport, two ragged blue tarps were laid in a cross formation on the ground. The fossil was rolled onto the tarp and wrapped up, and then the whole thing was secured with rope. Each person took one end of the tarp, hoisted the fossil up, and walked up the hill. Lifting and dragging the fossil...
