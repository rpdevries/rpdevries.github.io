Traveling to Wyoming to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur - digging in the dirt with my bare hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster - was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills of Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation - home to famous dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Stegosaurus - to finish the excavation of a 15-ton diplodocoid.
