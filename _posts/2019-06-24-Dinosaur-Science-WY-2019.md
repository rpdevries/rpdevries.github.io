Traveling to Wyoming to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur, digging in the dirt with my hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster, was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation, home to famous dinosaurs such as X, X, and X, to finish the excavation of a X-ton diplodocoid.
