Traveling out West to unearth a new diplocodoid dinosaur - digging in the dirt with my bare hands, a geohammer, a jackhammer, covered in sweat, dirt, and plaster - was my first introduction to vertebrate paleontology. Guided by veteran paleontologist Prof. Paul Sereno, I and the other students of UChicago's 2019 Dinosaur Science course ventured into the rolling hills of Wyoming to the Jurassic Morrison Formation - home to famous dinosaurs such as *Allosaurus*, *Camarasaurus*, and *Stegosaurus* - to finish the excavation of a 15-ton diplodocoid.
<br>

The diplodocoid's fossilized remains rested on the side of a rust-red and blue-grey Morrison hill.

After a flurry of shovel-work, we managed to reach the original layer of rock marked in the site maps and photographs. We then got on the ground and went to work with geohammers and picks, shovels and brushes, and most importantly, our trusty fossil glue B-72.
