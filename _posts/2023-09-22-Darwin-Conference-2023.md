At UChicago Darwinian Sciences Cluster Retreat 2023, I presented a poster and interactive demo of *FossilScope*: An Interactive Application for Documenting 3D Skeletal Restoration. *FossilScope* is a free application that will allow the user to understand the steps taken to restore a fossil skeleton by displaying the information through direct engagement with the 3D skeletal mesh - i.e. the selection of fossil or muscle elements. 

The most recent interactive demo of *FossilScope* features the flesh and skeletal models of *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus*. The user can toggle the visibility of the flesh model on or off to access the bones of the skeleton. With the flesh model visible, the user can click on a flesh partition (demo: trunk sail) or the center of mass to view a summary note and important statistics. With the flesh model hidden, the user can click on a bone in the skeleton (demo: femur & calcaneum) to view a summary note, fossil specimen ID(s), an outline of the restorative steps taken, and images of the original bone(s) or reference images of a sculpted bone. Bone regions (demo: hind limb) can be selected with shift-click to view a summary note, fossil specimen IDs, and images. Muscles can also be clicked (demo: mAMES = adductor mandibulae externus superficialis muscle) to view important statistics and additional text information. Text information such as a paper citation or online CT data can be hyperlinked. This interactive demo is only the beginning of *FossilScope*, and we plan to include many more features in the final product.
