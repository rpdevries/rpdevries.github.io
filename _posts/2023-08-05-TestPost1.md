Tutorial Placeholder

This is a paragraph in my first post.
Show off your Markdown!

## Heading Two 

Any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.
Leave an blank line between headings and paragraphs.
Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.
Code can be highlighted with `backticks`.

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four

In Markdown, adding an image looks similar to a link.

I found this [Cat image on Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:VAN_CAT.png).

Horizontal rule:

--------------

> A block quote.
> Is like this.

A table:

| header | column a | column b |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dogs | 3 | 6 |
| cats | 3 | 6 |
| muffins | 15 | 30 |
