## Digital restoration of a small thyreophoran dinosaur

A small, armored dinosaur was excavated in Niger, Africa, by Prof. Paul Sereno. I am working on the digital restoration of the skeleton in the programs Amira and Blender. Amira is used to segment fossil CT scans, and Blender is used to assemble the skeleton and restore individual fossils through [armature-based retrodeformation](https://rainadevries.com/03_FossilRestoration/) and digital sculpting.
